# Final-Project-Group-B


# Topic and data source

We've chosen to review historic rent prices across the US and to create a machine learning model to predict rent prices in the future. The reason we've chosen this topic is the information contained in the data is of interest to us and we think the resulting predictions will be helpful to others. We will be using rental data from Zillow.com which contains rental averages over the period of 2014-2020 and is broken down by zip code and month. Zillow provides this data as a flat csv file. 

## With out project we hope to answer a few questions:

* What will rent prices be in 2022 and beyond?
* Which markets will show the most dramatic increase in rent in the future?
* Which markets are predicted to have the smallest increased in rent prices? 

## Group Communication

We will be utilizing Slack as our main form of communication
